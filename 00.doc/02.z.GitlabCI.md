#### Side-Channel Exercise: Continuous Integration

Your task is to research what Continuous Integration is and how you can benefit from using it.
Please prepare a short presentation highlighting:

* the definition of CI
* use cases 
* how you set up & configured [gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) for your project

For the last point, 
 modify the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your repository to test your implementation directories.
