## Composition

MontiArc describes the architecture of a system and statecharts describe the behavior of a system.
Combining them into one language would lead to a DSL that can both describe the  architecture 
 and the behavior of a system which can be very useful in many situations.
To achieve this, 
 you will write a new grammar that composes both of these grammars into a new one.
Definitions of statecharts should only be allowed inside definitions of components.


#### Exercise 3
Create a grammar `MontiArcWithStatecharts` that can parse the models that you can
 find under `src/test/resources/tutorial/montiarcwithstatecharts`.
Compose the grammar from the grammars `MontiArc` and `Statecharts`. 
Add the Type Checking and Context Conditions of both languages to this
 language and reuse the code you wrote in the first two exercises as much as possible. 
Are there any Context Conditions that should be added to the language now that it is possible
 to write statecharts and components into one model?
Write tests for all aspects of your grammar.


#### Presentation Exercise
Prepare a presentation to demonstrate all three grammars of this Chapter.
Explain why you have chosen your symbol table the way you have done,
 as well as the various CoCos.
