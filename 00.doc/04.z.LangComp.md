#### Side-Channel Exercise: Language Composition

Your task is to research what language composition is and how you can benefit from using it.
Please prepare a short presentation highlighting:

* the various kinds of language composition
* use cases and benefits
* which kind(s) of composition you are using in the exercises of chapter 4 
* further use cases for compositions you can think of (e.g, the tool you have extended with pretty printing functionality)

*Hint:* You may want to take a look at a specific chapter of the MontiCore handbook for some of these points.
